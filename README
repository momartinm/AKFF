This directory contains the C implementation of Abstract Metric-FF, 
as it was used to generate abstractions to decrease the computational
overhead of the planning process. This planner has been built using 
the version 2.1 of Metric-FF created by Joerg Hoffmann. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

ff

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,

Moisés Martínez
